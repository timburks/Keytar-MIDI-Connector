Maps a Wii RockBand 3 Keyboard's USB dongle HID events to Mac OS X MIDI events.

Plug in the dongle before launching the application.

(The whole thing needs lots of work. But it does the job.)

This allows you to use your Wii RockBand 3 Keyboard with Garageband or
the marvelous Synthesia [ http://www.synthesiagame.com/ ].

Share and Enjoy!

The end goal is to map the same functionality you would have using the MIDI port on the Keytar.  Here are the buttons
that are implemented so far:

  * **1** - Lower Octave
  * **2** - Not Implemented
  * **A** - Not Implemented
  * **B** - Raise Octave
